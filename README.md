## Reading order and requirements
To install all the Python dependencies, listed in `requirements.txt`, use the following command in a virtual environment:
```{sh}
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
All report content is in the directory:
* report

The report consists of the analysis of 4 different datasets, so a specific reading order is not vital, however the order below may be a good suggestion:
* 01-Python.Analysis
* 02-LoanDataAnalysis
* 03-python_analysis
* 04-Python_Analysis_For_Loan_Data
* 05-Wrapup
